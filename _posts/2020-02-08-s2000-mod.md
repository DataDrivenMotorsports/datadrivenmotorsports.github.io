Karl purchased this S2000 in August of 2019. At $8500, it was somewhat of a steal
for a car with just 104K on the clock! However, the car is rebuilt title due to 
theft, but reclaimed by the same owner. Also...the car looked just about how
it does above, minus the exhaust. The car alread had aero, a gutted interior, and
a rollbar. The basic track essentials but required a few missing pieces: seats,
a not-straight-piped-exhaust, and additional cooling for extended race track sessions. The 2020 year is all about getting this car dialed for continued track abuse.
