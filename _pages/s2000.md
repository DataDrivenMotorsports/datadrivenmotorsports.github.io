*IT'S OVER 9000!*

In August of 2019, we acquired our second flagship chassis, a 2001 Honda S2000. 
Anyone familiar to circuit racing will know it's no secret that S2000s perform well
on track with minimal modifications. But what really drew Karl to the S2000 was the
"knife-edge" experience the AP1 chassis offers. Despite being one of the first mainstream
car's with electronic power steering, the car is extremely connected to the driver, 
yet unforgiving in novice hands. Yet in today's world they are vastly underpowered
in today's landscape of track offerings. Nevertheless, Karl's S2000 has an ultimate
goal of being competitive in [GTA]'s and [Gridlife]'s limited class along side
Project S-HR.

Be sure to catch us competing at [Global Time Attack, The Ridge]!

Best Lap Times:
* High Plains Raceway - 2:00.8 (Target: 1:58)
